            Search results are based on font and font designer names which most
            closely match your query, and are ranked using the following
            factors: (1) web usage of the font family; (2) trend in web usage of
            the font family; (3) the number of styles in the font family; (4)
            the date the font family was added to Google Fonts; and/or (5) how
            applicable the font family is to the dominant language(s) in your
            country (based on your location and settings). The relative weight
            given to each factor is determined by the sorting method you
            chooseâ€”for example, the date the font family was added to Google
            Fonts will play a bigger role if you choose to sort by Newest.
